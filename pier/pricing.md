## Pricing is based on your storage and monthly network use

Docker images take up space in the data backend of the docker registry
 
Each push or pull of a docker image causes network use

## Pier plans

We offer 3 Pier plans : Blue, Silver and Gold

When you register for a Pier account the first month of your plan is free, you can stop your account any time without being billed during that first month

Each plan offers a certain level of data storage and network use per month

You can pay for your plan on a monthly or yearly basis - after the first free month you'll be billed for your next monthly or yearly period

You can stop your account at any moment on the Pier website

Plan | Storage | Network | monthly | yearly 
:----:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:
Blue | 10 GB | 10 GB/m | 2€ | 15€
Silver | 20 GB | 20 GB/m | 3€ | 25€
Gold | 40 GB | 40 GB/m | 5€ | 45€

* When your storage and/or your network use limits are reached you'll receive errors when pulling/pushing to your repositories
* You can change your plan at any moment in time (without changing the billing frequency)
    * when upgrading your plan a prorata bill will be generated for the remaining days in the current billing period
    * when downgrading your plan, the new plan and price will be applied to your next billing period 
* If you're using the Gold plan you can add extra Storage or monthly Network use to your plan as add-ons to the Gold plan
    * each addon of 10 GB Storage will add 0.25€ to your monthly bill or 2.5€ to your yearly bill
    * each addon of 10 GB Network use per month will add 0.5€ to your monthly bill or 5€ to your yearly bill
