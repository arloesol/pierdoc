These Terms are effective February 19, 2016.

These Pier.ovh Terms of Service (these “Terms”) apply to the features and functions provided by Arloesol.com. (“Arloesol”, “our,” or “we”) via [www.pier.ovh] (the “Site”) (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use any of the Services. The “Effective Date” of these Terms is the date you first access any of the Services.

If you are accessing the Services in your capacity as an employee, consultant or agent of a company (or other entity), you represent that you are an employee, consultant or agent of such company (or other entity) and you have the authority to agree (and be legally bound) on behalf of such company (or other entity) to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms.

For the purpose of these Terms, you and, if applicable, such company (or other entity) constitutes “Customer” or “you”.

Arloesol reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms (or any policy or guideline of Arloesol) at any time and in its sole discretion by providing notice that these Terms have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an email, posting a notice on the Site, posting the revised Terms on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms or such other form of notice as determined by Arloesol. Any changes or modifications will be effective 30 days after providing notice that these Terms have been modified (the “Notice Period”). Your continued use of any of the Services following the Notice Period will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Therefore, you should review these Terms whenever you access the Services and at least every 30 days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.

These terms form a binding agreement between you and Arloesol.

## Your Responsibilities
If you share your repository, publish images, code or content, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Site (“Content”), you are entirely responsible for such Content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe, violate or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party;
if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (a) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (b) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
the Content is not spam, is not randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
the Content does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
your Content is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;

By submitting Content or computer code to Arloesol for inclusion in your repositories, you grant Arloesol a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing the services you request. If you delete Content, Arloesol will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Services, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Arloesol has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Arloesol’ sole discretion (a) refuse or remove any content that, in Arloesol’ reasonable opinion, violates any Arloesol policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (b) terminate or deny access to and use of the Site to any individual or entity for any reason, in Arloesol’ sole discretion.

Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, Arloesol, at its sole discretion, may modify its pricing during any Subscription Period and such modifications will be effective as of the directly subsequent Subscription Period.

Interest on any late payments will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid in full.

## General Provisions

### Assignment
Neither these Terms nor any right or duty under these Terms may be transferred, assigned or delegated by you, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Arloesol, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect. Arloesol may freely transfer, assign or delegate these Terms or its rights and duties under these Terms. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns.

### Amendments and Waivers
Unless expressly stated otherwise stated in your standard service terms, no modification, addition or deletion, or waiver of any rights under these Terms will be binding on a party unless clearly understood by the parties to be a modification or waiver and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party. No failure or delay (in whole or in part) on the part of a party to exercise any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof or effect any other right or remedy. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided hereunder or by law. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

An electronic notice will be deemed to have been received on the day of receipt as evidenced by such email.

### Severability
If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of these Terms will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled.
